Binary search works on the sorted arrays/lists

The idea is every time we see the middle element of the array and discard the half. The search is again performed but only in the half of the array.
The process is repeated again and again and array is divided in every step into half. The search space reduction happens in the format:

n,  n/2,  2/4,  n/8,  n/16 and so on....

Here is list of 164 problems based on binary search of different difficulty levels along with difficulty tag:

Suggestion: start with easy and solve 5-6 problems, then move to medium and solve 2-3 problems and then try 1 hard. Your binary search concept will be at decent level.
